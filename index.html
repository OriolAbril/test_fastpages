  A well known Catalan saying goes: "Xerrar pels descosits". It means that somebody talks
  too much. "xerrar" is talking and a "descosit" refers to pieces of fabric that have
  come undone or been unraveled. I generally do not talk too much, in fact I tend to talk
  too little unless we are talking about topics such as statistics or programming. I hope
  this blog can be a place to unravel concepts on statistics, open source and programming,
  allowing me to _xerrar pels descosits_ in blog version.

  Get ready for some puns and let's dive in!
