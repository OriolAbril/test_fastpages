I'm a renegade physicist/engineer who loves statistical data analysis. By day,
I am currently a Research Assistant on Bayesian Model Selection with
[David Rossell](https://sites.google.com/site/rosselldavid/) at UPF,
Barcelona. By night I am a core developer of
[ArviZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/) a Python package for exploratory
analysis of Bayesian models. In addition to data analysis, I also love
programming and teaching. I am also interested in open science and
reproducible research.

In my spare time, I like to play board games and going to the beach to do
water activities. I have been sailing and snorkeling regularly since I was
little and more I recently added kayaking to the mix too! I generally spend
the summer at the _Costa Brava_. Here I leave you a sneak peak of the views
when nobody is around
